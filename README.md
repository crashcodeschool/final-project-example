# final-project-example

### About
The purpose of this project is to provide CrashCode students with a boilerplate that they 
can use for guidance, inspiration, and troubleshooting on their final projects. The top priority 
is not to build a huge, complicated website, but to write clean, well-structured code and comment on it thoroughly. 
Hopefully, you will be able to understand each line of code, and apply similar logic to your own websites.

A word of caution: Please try not to copy and paste this code. Instead, read through it carefully,
write each line out, and make it your own.

### Wireframes
The website will be composed of three pages: Home, About, and Contact. 
We won't set up an actual mailer service for the Contact page, but instead alert 
the user with the contents of their email, and say that we will reach out shortly.

### Technologies Used

We use FontAwesome for our icons, Google Fonts for our fonts, and Bootstrap as a UI Library.
